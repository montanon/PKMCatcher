This repo is an attempt to create a DL based Takara Tomy Pokemon Figures images detector.

To be used in many different ways (?).

The principal approach consists of:
- Leverage novel DL models for Zero-shot Mask Image Segmentation to identify the Pokemon Figures in the images.
- Pass the masked segmentations to an Object Detector to identify the corresponding pokemon figure.
- This approach is leveraged for all the masked segmentations found in the image.

That's it.
